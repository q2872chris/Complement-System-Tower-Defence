C3b:C3 is the first protein in the Alternative pathway of the Complement system, it is switched from
a passive state to an active state by the immune system and split into C3b and C3a, C3b then tries to find an invading
pathogen to attach itself to, then it acts as a base for other proteins to attach to, to form more complex
structures, changes into C3bB when combined with a B protein.;
C3a:Formed when C3 splits into C3b and C3a (in this game C3 is formed by combining C3b and C3a which is the wrong way
around compared to how it really works), C3a's stream away from the area with the pathogens and call for backup from
other immune defences (eg phagocytes). C3a acts as a cytokine-a small cell signalling protein.;
B:This attaches to the C3b which is currently embedded in an invading cell, the C3b acts as a hook and is the correct
shape for the B protein to be able to combine with it to form C3bB.;
D:In reality this protein doesn't bind to C3bB but instead 'hits' it and alters its shape, in doing so a Ba protein
is released from the C3bB and it changes into a C3bBb protein. The D protein cleaves the B protein attached to the C3b
protein into Ba and Bb, the Bb remains attached to the C3b leaving C3bBb.;
P:The P protein attaches to C3bBb to form C3bBbp, this stabilises the C3bBb compound so later C5 Convertase can be formed.;
C3bB:Formed when a B protein attaches to C3b, changes into C3bBb when combined with a D protein.;
C3bBb:Formed when a D protein changes the shape of C3bB, changes into C3bBbp when combined with a P protein. As part
of the alternative pathway C3bBb can be referred to as C3 Convertase and can cleave C3 into C3b and C3a. It however is
labile (unstable/liable to change/easily altered) until a P combines with it to  form C3bBbp, it can undergo spontaneous
decay through dissociation of Bb (the Bb separates itself).;
C3bBbp:Formed when a P protein attaches to C3bBb, can change its shape to form C3 Convertase. C3bBb is referred to by
some sources as being the C3 Convertase complex of the alternative pathway, C3bBbp is then a more stable compound that
another C3b can bind to to form C5 Convertase.;
C3 Convertase:Formed when C3bBbp changes its shape, C3 Convertase (C4b2b, formerly C4b2a) acts as a recruiting platform to activate more
C3 proteins to form more C3 Convertase to attach to the pathogen, C3 Convertase can then act as a hook to help immune
cells grab bacteria as bacteria are hard to immune cells to grab and engulf normally, joining a C3b with C3 Convertase
forms C5 Convertase.;
C5 Convertase:This protein is part of the first step in the Lytic or Terminal pathway,
C5 Convertase, C4b2b3b, or (C3b)2BbP, can then split (cleave) C5 proteins into C5b and C5a. The special ability, while
not real, is similar to a process that happens in the complement system, when C3a proteins stream away from
the battlefield and call for backup, this is meant to represent the immune cells coming to help.;
C3:This is the first protein the Alternative pathway, normally is split into C3b and C3a upon activation but in this
game is formed by the combination of C3b and C3a.;
C5:This is the first protein in the Lytic or Terminal pathway of the complement system, it's split into C5b and C5a
upon activation, in this game however it is formed by the combination of C5b and C5a.;
C5b:Formed by the splitting of C5 into C5b and C5a, acts as a base to start forming a more complex structure, the
Membrane Attack Complex, C5b changes to C5bC6 when combined with a C6 protein.;
C5a:Formed as a by-product of C5 being split into C5b and C5a, like C3a it will try and call for 'backup' (leukocytes/etc).
Like C3a, C4a, and C2a, C5a acts as a cytokine-a small cell signalling protein.;
C6:C6 attaches to C5b to form C5bC6.;
C7:C7 attaches to C5bC6 to form C5b-C7.;
C8:C8 attaches to C5b-C7 to form C5b-C8.;
C9:Many C9's join with the Membrane Attack Complex to rip holes in attacking bacteria.;
C5bC6:Formed when C6 protein combines with C5b, changes into C5b-C7 when combined with a C7 protein.;
C5b-C7:Formed when C7 protein combines with C5bC6, changes into C5b-C8 when combined with a C8 protein.;
C5b-C8:Formed when C8 protein combines with C5b-C7, then modifies itself to form the Membrane Attack Complex.;
Attack Complex:Formed after C5b-C8 modifies its shape, C9's can then join with it to rip holes in the attacking
bacteria (causing them to lyse, the reason for the lytic pathway being another name for the terminal pathway-
breakdown their cell membranes) that this protein complex is attached to.;
MBL:This is a specialised protein designed to attach itself to viruses in ones body, viruses drift aimlessly and
MBL proteins when coming into contact with them render them useless and allow them to be picked up by other immune cells.;
Utilities:While this is not a real protein the two abilities it has are meant to represent real complement
processes, the first being summoning C3a's, C3a's stream away from the invaded area to call for immune cell
backup, and the second being changing the water concentration, active complement proteins are neutralised
quickly by water molecules if they don't find a target to protect one's own cells.;
Ba:Formed as a by-product of the D protein changing the shape of the C3bB protein to form C3bBb. The B in C3bB
is cleaved by D into Bb and Ba, the Ba is released while the Bb remains bound to the C3b to create C3bBb.;
MASP-1:The Lectin pathway is similar to the Classical pathway, it starts with MBL, multimers (a protein molecule made up
of 2 or more polypeptide chains, each referred to as monomers) of MBL form a complex with MASP-1, MASP-2, and MASP-3
(they are similar to the C1r and C1s proteins), when MASP-1 is activated it can cleave C4 and C2 in the same way as C1s.;
MASP-2:Forms complexes with multimers of MBL, MASP-2 can cleave C4 and C2 in the same way as C1s. After cleaving the
Lectin pathway follows the Classical and then Alternative and Terminal/Lytic pathways as normal.;
MBL Complex:MBL Complex-formed by multimers of MBL forming complexes with the MASP proteins.;
C1q:The Classical pathway (another way of reaching C3 Convertase-like the Alternative pathway) is initiated by the binding
of antigen-antibody complexes to the C1q protein, it then changes and activates the C1r protein. C1q is part of the inactive
C1 complex which consists of six molecules of C1q, two molecules of C1r, and two molecules of C1s.;
C1r:The activated C1r then cleaves and activates the C1s protein.;
C1s:The activated C1s cleaves C4 into C4b and C4a, and cleaves C2 into C2b and C2a.;
C1 Complex (1):This is a filler tower (not a real protein) in the combination sequence of C1q, C1r, and C1s, to make
the C1 Complex, in reality they do not combine to make the C1 Complex, instead the inactive C1 Complex holds the C1q,
C1r, and C1s proteins when not fighting off an attack.;
C1 Complex (2):The C1 Complex is made up of one or six molecules of C1q, two molecules of C1r, and two molecules of C1s.
In reality this protein is not created by the before mentioned other proteins combining to form it as part of the
Classical pathway.;
C4a:Cleaved (split) from C4 as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, its primary use is to stabilise the C4 protein
while it is inactive. C4a acts as a cytokine-a small cell signalling protein. C4a causes the degranulation of mast cells
and basophils, which means something to someone.;
C4b:Cleaved (split) from C4 as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, will bind to a pathogen (eg a bacteria cell
membrane, like the C3b protein does), then if not inactivated will combine with a C2b protein to form C4b2b
(C4bC2b, classical C3 Convertase, C4b2a, or C4bC2a), this pathway now follows the rest of the Alternative pathway and the
Lytic/Terminal pathway. (In the game C4a can be combined with C4b to create C4).;
C2a:Cleaved (split) from C2 as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, its primary use is to stabilise the C2 protein
while it is inactive. C2a acts as a cytokine-a small cell signalling protein. C2a acts to increase vascular permeability.;
C2b:Cleaved (split) from C2 as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, will combine with a C4b protein embedded
in a pathogen to form C4b2b (C3 Convertase), this pathway now follows the rest of the Alternative pathway and the
Lytic/Terminal pathway. (In the game C2a can also be combined with C2b to create C2). Historically C2b was referred to as
C3a, but the b postfix refers to the larger component, so it now is C2b.;
C4:C4 is cleaved into C4b and C4a as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, C4b and C2b come together to create
C4b2b, historically C4b2a (C3 Convertase). In reality C4b and C4a don't bind to make C4. (The b postfix is given to the
larger protein element, historically it often used to have the a postfix, eg would have been C4a instead of C4b).;
C2:C2 is cleaved into C2b and C2a as part of the Classical or Lectin pathway, C4b and C2b come together to create
C4b2b, historically C4b2a (C3 Convertase). In reality C2b and C2a don't bind to make C2 (The b postfix is given to the
larger protein element, historically it often used to have the a postfix, eg would have been C2a instead of C2b).
